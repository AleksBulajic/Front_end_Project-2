## MVP

1. Get a random game.
2. Delete the random game.
3. Update the random game.
4. Add a Game to the dastatbase from my front end.

## Streach Goals
 1. User Registration and Authentication: Implement a user registration and authentication system to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This would enable personalized features such as saving favorite games, tracking game progress, and participating in community discussions.
 
 2. Game Collections and Playlists: Allow users to create personalized game collections or playlists. Users can curate their own selection of games and share them with others. This feature can help users organize games based on various criteria, such as favorite games, games to play later, or games for specific occasions.

 3. Display some of the games on the page itselfe.
